About QUICK QM Package
======================

QUICK is a GPU enabled *ab initio* and density functional theory software capable of performing electronic
structure calculations on general organic/biomolecular systems. It was initially developed by Ed Brothers. His work includes the development of the Hartree-Fock and density functional theory energy and gradient calculations, geometry optimization routines, and Mulliken charge analysis. Afterward, Ken Ayers and Xiao He optimized the code.
Yipu Miao implemented the GPU enabled ERI engine and laid the foundation for GPU enabled DFT calculations.

Madu Manathunga, Chi Jin, Vinícius Wilian D. Cruzeiro, Andy Götz and Kennie Merz currently develop and maintain the code.
